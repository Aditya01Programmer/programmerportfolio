# 🌐 Aditya's Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio website!  
I'm **Aditya Tiwari**, a passionate **Frontend Developer** and JavaScript learner currently in **Class 12th (PCM)**, building websites and improving daily with code, curiosity, and consistency.  

This portfolio showcases who I am, what I can do, and how I build things from scratch — with love for **clean UI**, **CSS animations**, and **JavaScript logic** ✨
